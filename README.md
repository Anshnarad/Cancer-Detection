# Cancer-Detection
Cancer Detection of a Human Cell.
This is a simple Machine Learning model based on classification technique to determine whether a human cell is benign(non-cancerous) or malignant(cancerous). 

# Abstract
Cancer, as we all are aware, is one of the most deadly diseases to be ever encountered in the biomedical domain. According to the data (2013-2015) published by the National Cancer Institute, 38.4% of men and women gets diagnosed with cancer during their lifetime. These statistics show the impact of cancer across the world because of its potential to become incurable if not treated in the early stage of its development inside a human body. This is when the main idea behind the project "Cancer detection of a human cell (benign or malignant)" comes into play. The motive of this project is to make a prediction and give an early indication of whether the new sample is benign (gentle) or malignant (infectious) using Machine Learning Classification algorithm and SVM ( Support Vector Machine ).

# How it is made?
I have downloaded the dataset of a cell from thousands of patients who were believed to be at risk of developing cancer to make the machine learn from it and analyze it. Analysis of the data showed a significant difference between the characteristics of a benign and malignant cell. This analysis is then used with classification technique to determine the class label for an unlabelled test case. I have used various powerful python libraries and data analysis toolkits like pandas, scipy, numpy, sci-kit learn etc to make this project powerful and efficient. 

# Where it can be used?
This project can be tremendously useful in the healthcare industry and hospitals all across the globe by not only saving the lives of millions on an everyday basis but by also saving an enormous amount of time and energy which makes it economically beneficial as well.

# To Run this:-
You will need to install the following dependencies on your machine:-

`pip install pandas`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install pylab`

`pip install scipy`

`pip install sklearn`

You will also have to download dataset in csv format, which can be download from here: `cell_samples.csv`
Once all the libraries are successfully installed in your machine, copy the code and run to see if you don't get any errors.
